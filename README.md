# Palindrome Validator

## Preface
Palindrome Validator is a simple program that I created for a university assignment.

## What is a Palindrome
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same sequence of character forwards and backwords. For example, the word "radar" is a palindrom.

## Overview
Palindrome Validator will ask the user for a word or phrase. Then, once the user enters a value and presses the enter key, the program will determine if the value is a palindrome or not. The program will continue to prompt for phrases until "x" in inputted.
